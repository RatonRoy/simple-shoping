			In my opinion, React is a javascript library So behind the sense react actually run the javascript code. React code work do like a tree and create virtual DOM and execute the code based on the js DOM. React reduce the same structure things code by the creation of component.  Once the component creates then pass the different data use props or useState or useEffect or other ways so that we create our web page efficiently and easily.  Another important thing I want to share is that react code act like water flow means it sends data only in the upper to lower direction.
